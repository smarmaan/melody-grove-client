# Melody Grove Website

Welcome to Melody Grove, a platform for online courses in music and arts. Here are some of the best features our website offers:

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** In order to book courses, users are required to log in. If a user tries to book a course without logging in, they will be redirected to the login page with an alert message.

2. **Role-Based Access Control:** Admins and instructors cannot book courses. The booking button is disabled for them, ensuring that only students can enroll in the courses.

3. **Secure Routing:** Our website ensures secure routing for every user, protecting their sensitive information and providing a safe browsing experience.

4. **Enhanced User Security:** We prioritize the security of all types of users on our platform. We employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard user data and protect against unauthorized access.

5. **Payment Integration:** We have implemented a secure payment section where users can make payments for the courses they want to enroll in. This ensures a seamless and convenient payment experience.

6. **Real-Time Seat Updates:** Upon successful payment, the available seats for the corresponding course are updated in real-time on the class page's course card information. Users can see the remaining seats before making a booking decision.

7. **Instructor Dashboard:** After a successful payment, the instructor of the course can view the number of enrolled students in their dashboard. This feature helps instructors stay informed about the popularity of their courses.
